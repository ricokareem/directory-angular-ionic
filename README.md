## To run a browser locally for development ##

Included is a package.json, only needed if you wish
to debug part of your app via a browser
(ie: using Dev Tools).

However, if you only wish to use an emulator or mobile
device for development, the package.json file can
be ignored.

To install local-web-server
```
npm install
```
To run local-web-server
```
npm start

Then point your browser to
```
http://localhost:8000
```

You do not need to restart the server for most changes,
just refresh the page.

More information on how to use local-web-server is
